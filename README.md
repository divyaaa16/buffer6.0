🚨 Problem Statement
Women often face challenges in accessing immediate legal help when dealing with harassment, domestic violence, or workplace discrimination. Legal systems are often complex, slow, and intimidating, leaving many unaware of their rights or hesitant to seek support.

💡 Our Solution — SafeGuard
SafeGuard is an AI-powered legal assistant built to empower women with instant, reliable, and accessible legal support. It provides:

🧠 AI Chatbot for legal guidance

📝 Automated complaint drafting

⚖️ Connection with nearby lawyers

📍 Case tracking & legal rights info

🚨 SOS emergency support + fake legal call

🌐 Voice commands & accessibility-first design

🔧 DSA Integration (Core of the Solution)
To make the project technically strong and competition-ready, we’ve integrated Data Structures & Algorithms in the following ways:

🌳 Legal Rights Tree
A tree structure is used to organize legal rights. Root nodes represent broader law categories (e.g., harassment, workplace rights), and child nodes hold specific sub-laws. The chatbot traverses this tree using DFS to offer context-specific legal suggestions.

🔗 Complaint Registration Flow using Graphs
The complaint journey is modeled as a directed graph, with each node representing a legal action (e.g., collect evidence → file complaint → police station). We use DFS for guided navigation and shortest path algorithms to recommend the most efficient legal steps.

🔍 Pattern Matching using Trie / Hashing (Planned)
For recognizing keywords in user messages (e.g., "help", "violence", "stalking"), we’re planning trie/hash maps to detect patterns and trigger appropriate bot responses instantly.

📊 Priority Queues for Urgency Detection
In the SOS system, reported cases are pushed into a priority queue, which sorts help requests based on severity/urgency levels using a custom comparator.

These DSA features are not just backend logic—they also power visible features like chatbot responses, UI flows, and legal suggestions.
